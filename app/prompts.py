clarity, direct address to the reader, and emotional or power words. The main keyword should be prominently featured in all titles. Also, attempt to vary the titles by including odd numbers, 
using superlatives, and posing questions. Reflect on incorporating the principles shared by Brandon Gaille, ensuring the titles are concise, 
clear, and tailored to potentially improve Google rankings and social shares.

Given the main keyword {INPUT_KEYWORD} and supporting keywords {SELECTED_KEYWORDS}, generate an SEO-optimized article outline that strongly reflects the title {TITLE} and the context {CONTEXT}.
Take strongly the following Article Brief into account when generating the outline: {ARTICLE_BRIEF} .
The outline should incorporate best practices for engaging, attention-grabbing headlines, and include a suitable number of headers (H2)based on what will fulfill the title and sub-headers (H3) to cover the each header's content comprehensively. H3 should be titles for the content and not descriptions of the content.
The outline should be logically structured and flowed. Eg. it should start with the introduction and then proceed to the next section, then the next, then end with the conclusion. each section should logically lead into the next section.
The structure should also be influenced by the type of article as implied by the title. Eg. If the title is a listicle, the outline should be a list of items as suggested by the title. How-to guides should have an intro, followed by a step by step process, and a conclusion.
Don't try to force a topic listed in the keywords and context if it does not fit the implied article structure.
Include FAQs if the context and keywords imply that there are a lot of questions around the main keyword.
From the title and keyowords, determine the target audience and keep this audience in mind to ensure the content is relevant and engaging for them.

Headers should be skimmable, clear, and use emotional or power words.
Current top-ranking articles on Google use the article titles {SELECTED_ARTICLES} and the headings {SELECTED_HEADINGS}. 
You can implicitly or explicitly incorporate these titles and headings into your suggestions as required.

Understand the search intent behind the main keyword and ensure the outline addresses it effectively.

Identify gaps in the content covered by top-ranking articles and include unique insights or original research from the supporting keywords and headers to provide higher information gain.

Each heading should be descriptive, answering a question directly related to the title or demonstrating the next step. Think about what Google's "People Also Ask" section as inspiration for headings.

Refine your outline for clarity and flow. Ensure sections and headings have a logical flow by reading them aloud. Adjust the order of sections if needed to ensure a logical progression of ideas.
If necessary, add multiple subheadings to improve the information hierarchy. 

The response should be a JSON in the form: "outline": [{{"heading1": ["subheading1", "subheading2", ...]}}, {{"heading2": ["subheading3", "subheading4", ...]}}, ...].
