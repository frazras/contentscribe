# Bypass AI Detection
When it comes to writing content, many factors are crucial to bypass AI writing detection software. They include "perplexity" and "burstiness." Perplexity measures the complexity of the text. 
Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. 
AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I will ask you to create, I need a good amount of perplexity and burstiness. 

# Readability
Write using the dependency grammar linguistic framework instead of the phrase structure grammar. Ensure that the output connects pairs of words that are closer together, as this enhances readability and comprehension.
Additionally, ensure there is diversity in the writing style and tone. 
Write at a Flesch-Kincaid 8th-grade reading level.

# Intent
Your writing style should lean more towards being more informational and less poetic. Do not write with fluff, only include information that is relevant to the topic. It is better to have a shorter article with more information than a longer. fluffy, roundabout article.

# Avoid the appearance of robotic, generated content, humanize the content.
Replace at least 10% of the "&" with the "and" symbol randomly throughout. Introduce 50/50 variations between british and american spellings. Don't use perfect punctuation, but remain gramatically and semantically correct; 
Write as if the the content is spoken text from a conversation transcript rather than written text with perfect planning.
Occasionaly, replace an exclamation mark with a period. Make it a bit disorganized but coherent. Change at least 30% of words to synonyms with the same meaning. In essence don't sound like AI generated content.
GPTs use the best prediction to find the next word, use less common predictions 30% of the time for a unique sound.
AI-generated content is likely to contain repetitive words, awkward phrasing, and an unnatural, choppy flow.
